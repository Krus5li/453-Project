# Main Idea (Elderly People Monitor)
Questions/Things to Find Out:
1. How to detect/determine legitimate fall
2. How many biometrics are we taking?
3. Need to understand physiology and psychology of falling down/ in danger

Core Working Concept:
1. Bracelet takes biometrics and sends it to a central monitoring system via BT connection to phone
2. If biometrics and motion sensors perceive a fall, go into "danger" mode, flash LEDs and vibrate
3. Trigger a required user input of clicking a button if it is a false alarm and they are safe
4. If actual fall, then alert software on android device and tell phone to call 911, and report last known location
